Learning to drive is a significant milestone that comes with a blend of excitement and responsibility. In the UK, the process is structured to ensure that new drivers are well-prepared for the road. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to get started, from obtaining a provisional licence to booking your practical test.

### Step 1: Check You're Allowed to Drive

Before you start learning to drive, ensure that you meet the legal requirements:

- **Age Requirement**: Most people can start learning to drive when they’re 17.
- **Check What Age You Can Drive**: Different vehicles have different minimum age requirements. [Check the legal driving age](https://www.gov.uk/vehicles-can-drive) for various vehicle types.
- **Legal Obligations**: Familiarize yourself with the [legal obligations for drivers](https://www.gov.uk/legal-obligations-drivers-riders).
- **Eyesight Rules**: Ensure your eyesight meets the required standards. More details can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/driving-eyesight-rules).

### Step 2: Get a Provisional Licence

To start driving lessons or practice driving, you need a provisional driving licence. Here's how to get one:

- **Apply for Your Provisional Licence**: You can apply online or by post. For more information and to apply, visit the [official application page](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence).

### Step 3: Take Driving Lessons and Practice

Once you have your provisional licence, you can begin driving lessons. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Find an Instructor**: Choose a qualified driving instructor to guide you through the learning process. 
- **Driving Practice**: Practice driving with your instructor and, if possible, with someone who meets the requirements to supervise learners.

### Step 4: Prepare for Your Theory Test

The theory test is a crucial step in obtaining your driving licence. It consists of two parts: multiple-choice questions and a hazard perception test.

- **Study the Highway Code**: The [Highway Codes](/highway-codes-page/) is essential reading for the theory test.
- **Practice Online**: Use online resources and apps to practice theory test questions and hazard perception clips.

### Step 5: Book and Take Your Practical Driving Test

After passing your theory test, you can book your practical driving test. Here’s how to prepare:

- **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Ensure you have enough practice to feel confident behind the wheel.
- **Know the Test Routes**: Familiarize yourself with the common test routes in your area.
- **Book Your Test**: Schedule your practical driving test online. Read how to book your test [here](/how-to-book-a-theory-test/).

### Additional Tips
