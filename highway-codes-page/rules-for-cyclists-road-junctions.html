<div class="paragraph">72<br /><strong>Road positioning.</strong>&nbsp;When riding on the roads, there are two basic road positions you should adopt, depending on the situation.<br /><span></span>1) Ride in the centre of your lane, to make yourself as clearly visible as possible, in the following situations<br /><span></span><ul style="color:rgb(11, 12, 12)"><li>on quiet roads or streets &ndash; if a faster vehicle comes up behind you, move to the left to enable them to overtake, if you can do so safely</li><li>in slower-moving traffic - when the traffic around you starts to flow more freely, move over to the left if you can do so safely so that faster vehicles behind you can overtake</li><li>at the approach to junctions or road narrowings where it would be unsafe for drivers to overtake you</li></ul>2) When riding on busy roads, with vehicles moving faster than you, allow them to overtake where it is safe to do so whilst keeping at least 0.5 metres away, and further where it is safer, from the kerb edge. Remember that traffic on most dual carriageways moves quickly. Take extra care crossing slip roads.<br /><span></span><br />73<strong>Junctions.</strong>&nbsp;Some junctions, particularly those with traffic lights, have special cycle facilities, including small cycle traffic lights at eye-level height, which may allow you to move or cross separately from or ahead of other traffic. Use these facilities where they make your journey safer and easier.<br /><span></span>At junctions with no separate cyclist facilities, it is recommended that you proceed as if you were driving a motor vehicle (see&nbsp;Rules 170 to 190).<br /><span></span>Position yourself in the centre of your chosen lane, where you feel able to do this safely, to make yourself as visible as possible and to avoid being overtaken where this would be dangerous. If you do not feel safe to proceed in this way, you may prefer to dismount and wheel your bike across the junction.<br /><span></span><br />74<br /><strong>Turning.</strong>&nbsp;When approaching a junction on the left, watch out for vehicles turning in front of you, out of or into the side road. If you intend to turn left, check first for other cyclists or motorcyclists before signalling. Do not ride on the inside of vehicles signalling or slowing down to turn left.<br /><span></span>If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the road.<br /><span></span>When turning into or out of a side road, you should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross (see&nbsp;Rule H2).<br /><span></span><br />75<br /><strong>Two Stage Turns.</strong>&nbsp;At some signal-controlled junctions there may be signs and markings informing cyclists to turn right in two stages:<br /><span></span>Stage 1: When the traffic lights turn green, cyclists wishing to make the turn should go straight ahead to the location marked by a cycle symbol and turn arrow on the carriageway; then stop and wait there<br /><span></span>Stage 2: When the traffic lights on the far side of the junction, now facing the cyclists, turn green, they should then complete the manoeuvre<br /><span></span></div>
