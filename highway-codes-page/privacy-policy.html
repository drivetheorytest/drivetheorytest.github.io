<div class="paragraph">&#8203;Effective: May 21, 2018.</div>

<div class="paragraph">&#8203;The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how DrivingEd collects, uses and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including www.HighwayCodeUK.co.uk (collectively referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at info@drivinged.eu . Your use of our Site is also governed by our <a href="terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>.<br /><br /></div>

<div class="paragraph"><br /><strong>&#8203;What Information this Privacy Policy Covers</strong><br />This Privacy Policy covers information we collect from you through our Site. Some of our Site&rsquo;s functionality can be used without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information, though for features or services related to the Online Courses, Personally Identifiable Information is required. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit, or we may collect, "Personally Identifiable Information" (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to Site. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.<br />&#8203;<br /><strong>What You Agree to by Using Our Site</strong><br />Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, we may not be able to provide you with the services that can be offered on our Site. Consent can be withdrawn at any time by navigating to your profile page and clicking the box to remove consent or deleting your account. Please note that we may also rely on legitimate interests or fulfilment of a contract to continue processing your data.<br /><br /><strong>What Information We Collect</strong><br />We gather two types of information about users through the Site:<br /><br /><em>Information relating to your use of our Site.</em> When users come to our Site, we may track, collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Site. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user&rsquo;s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.<br />We also use (or may use) cookies and web beacons when you visit our Site. For more information on our use of cookies and web beacons, please refer to our Cookie Policy.<br /><br /><em>Personally Identifiable Information provided directly by you or via third parties.</em> We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you register for an account, update or change information for your account, purchase products or services, complete a survey, sign-up for email updates or Online Courses, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, and/or participate in Online Courses or other services on our Site. We may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific course and/or services you select, send you updates about Online Courses offered by DrivingEd or other DrivingEd events, and send you email messages about Site maintenance or updates.<br />&#8203;<br />Account Registration. If you register for an account on our Site, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address.<br /><br />Updates. DrivingEd may offer you the ability to receive updates either via email or by posting on portions of the Site only accessible to registered users. In order to subscribe to these services, you may be required to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address.<br /><br />Forums. DrivingEd&nbsp;may offer public forums from time to time (the "Forums") where you can share comments and thoughts. In order to participate in the Forums, you may be required to register with us and/or provide us with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name and email address. Please keep in mind that information you post or make available in Forums will be publicly available. You should not post any Personally Identifiable Information or other information of a personal or sensitive nature, whether relating to you or another person, on a Forum. Please also reference our Terms of Use for our Rules for Online Conduct and additional information about proper use of our Forums.<br /><br />Participation in Online Courses. DrivingEd offers users the opportunity to participate in an Online Course on or through the Site. If you desire to participate in a course, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such a course. This information may include, among other things, your name and email address.<br /><br />If you participate in an online course, we may collect from you certain student-generated content, such as assignments you submit to instructors, peer-graded assignments, and peer grading student feedback. We also collect course data, such as student responses to in-video quizzes, standalone quizzes, exams, and surveys. You should not include any Personally Identifiable Information or other information of a personal or sensitive nature, whether relating to you or another person, on assignments, exams, or surveys, except for information required to participate or submit such assignments, exams, or surveys.<br /><br />Identity Verification. DrivingEd may offer you the ability to verify your identity for selected classes. In order to enroll for these services, you may be required to provide us or our third-party identity verification vendor with Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address, date of birth, a headshot taken using a webcam, and a photo identification document. Additionally, if you apply for financial aid in connection with these services, you may be required to provide information regarding your income.<br /><br />Communications with DrivingEd. We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us.<br /><br />Third Party Sites.

We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you provide information in response to a survey operated by us. This may include details about your education history and your employment.<br /><br />Partner sites. Partner sites providing Online Course related tools and services to DrivingEd users may collect nonfinancial individual level user data regarding the individual&rsquo;s use of that partner site while engaged with such Online Course related activities, and the partner sites may share that data with DrivingEd for the purpose of improving DrivingEd&rsquo;s services, the partner site&rsquo;s services, and the individual&rsquo;s education experience. This data includes information such as the amount of time spent on the partner site and pages viewed.<br /><br />Third Party Credit Card Processing. DrivingEd&nbsp;provides you with the ability to pay for Online Courses and other services using a credit card through a third party payment processing service provider. Please note that our service provider &ndash; not DrivingEd &ndash; collects and processes your credit card information.<br />&#8203;<br /><strong>How We Use the Information</strong><br />Information relating to your use of our Site.

You should not post any Personally Identifiable Information or other information of a personal or sensitive nature, whether relating to you or another person, within a Forum post. If you choose to post Personally Identifiable Information, such Personally Identifiable Information may be collected during your use of the Forums. We may publish this information via extensions of our Platform that use third-party services, like mobile applications. We also reserve the right to reuse Forum posts that contain Personally Identifiable Information in future versions of the courses we offer, and to enhance future course offerings. We may archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you and/or your designee(s), and/or provide it to the University partner, business partner, or the instructor(s) associated with the courses you have taken. We may also use or publish posts submitted on the Forums without using Personally Identification Information.<br /><br />Participation in Online Courses. We use the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you when you participate in an Online Course through the Site for processing purposes, including but not limited to tracking attendance, progress, and completion of an Online Course. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information and your performance in a given Online Course with the instructor or instructors who taught the course, with teaching assistants or other individuals designated by the instructor or instructors to assist with the creation, modification or operation of the course, and with the institution or institutions with which they are affiliated. Also, we may archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you, where we are legally entitled to do so.<br /><br />Identity Verification. For services that require identity verification, we use the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect for verifying your identity, and for authenticating that submissions made on the Site were made by you. This service may be provided through a third-party identity verification vendor. Your photo identification document will be deleted after successful verification of your profile information.<br /><br />Communications with DrivingEd. When you send us an email message or otherwise contact us, we may use the information provided by you to respond to your communication and/or as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you where we are legally entitled to do so.<br /><br />Disclosure to DrivingEd Operations and Maintenance Contractors. We use various service providers, vendors and contractors (collectively, "Contractors") to assist us in providing our products and services to you. Our Contractors may have limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing their products or services to us, so that we in turn can provide our products and services to you. These Contractors may include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to the operation and maintenance of the Site or the Online Course. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for us.<br /><br />Government Authorities, Legal Rights and Actions. DrivingEd may share your Personally Identifiable Information with various government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights or to protect our property; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of DrivingEd, the Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.<br /><br />Disclosure to Acquirers. DrivingEd may disclose and/or transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with a sale, merger, or reorganization of all or substantially all of the equity, business or assets of DrivingEd to which your Personally Identifiable Information relates.<br /><br />e-Readers. If we receive any Personally Identifiable Information related to the extent to which you use designated e-Readers to access DrivingEd materials, we may archive it, and use it for research, business, or other purposes.<br />&#8203;<br /><strong>External Links</strong><br />For your convenience we may provide links to sites operated by organizations other than DrivingEd ("Third Party Sites") that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to these Third Party Sites without obtaining your consent. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses your Personally Identifiable Information.<br /><br /><strong>Retention of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />If you reside or are located in the EEA, we keep your Personally Identifiable Information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the Personally Identifiable Information is processed. The length of time we retain Personally Identifiable Information for depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.<br /><br /><strong>Confidentiality &amp; Security of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails communications are typically not encrypted and should not be considered secure.<br /><br /><strong>Updating or Deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br />You have certain rights in relation to your Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information and confirm that it remains correct and up-to-date or choose whether or not you wish to receive material from us or some of our partners by logging into the Site and visiting your user account page.<br /><br />If you would like further information in relation to your rights or would like to exercise any of them, you may also contact us via info@drivinged.eu. If you reside or are located in the EEA, you have the right to request that we:<ul><li>provide access to any Personally Identifiable Information we hold about you;</li><li>prevent the processing of your Personally Identifiable Information for direct-marketing purposes;</li><li>update any Personally Identifiable Information which is out of date or incorrect;</li><li>delete any Personally Identifiable Information which we are holding about you;</li><li>restrict the way that we process your Personally Identifiable Information;</li><li>provide your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party provider of services; or</li><li>provide you with a copy of any Personally Identifiable Information which we hold about you.</li></ul><br />We try to answer every email promptly where possible, and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within our databases, access logs and other records, which may or may not contain your Personally Identifiable Information. Please also note that certain Personally Identifiable Information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your Personally Identifiable Information to comply with a legal obligation.<br /><br />When you email us with a request, we may ask that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.<br /><br /><strong>Questions, Suggestions and Complaints</strong><br />If you have any privacy-related questions, suggestions, unresolved problems, or complaints you may contact us via info@drivinged.eu.<br />If you reside or are located in the EEA, our Data Protection Officer and Privacy Team may assist with all queries regarding our processing of Personally Identifiable at info@drivinged.eu.<br />If you reside or are located in the EEA, you may also make a complaint to our supervisory body for data protection matters (namely the UK Information Commissioner's Office) or seek a remedy through local courts if you believe that your rights have been breached.<br /><br /><strong>International Privacy Practices</strong><br />DrivingEd&rsquo;s Sites are primarily operated and managed on servers located and operated within the United States and Lithuania. In order to provide our products and services to you, we may send and store your Personally Identifiable Information (also commonly referred to as personal data) outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to the United States and Lithuania. Accordingly, if you reside or are located outside of the United States and Lithuania, your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your Personally Identifiable Information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information when it is transferred. If you reside or are located within the EEA and such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as you would have within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Changing Our Privacy Policy</strong><br />Please note that we review our privacy practices from time to time, and that these practices are subject to change. Any change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on our Site. We will notify you of any material change to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on our Site&rsquo;s homepage for a reasonable period of time following such update, and by changing the effective date (located at the bottom of this page). Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of this Privacy Policy.<br />&#8203;<br /><strong>No Information from Children Under 13</strong><br />DrivingEd&nbsp;strongly believes in protecting the privacy of children. In line with this belief, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information on our Site from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site is directed to persons under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access this Site at any time or in any manner.
