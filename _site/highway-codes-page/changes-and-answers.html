				<div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/8376784_orig.jpg" alt="highway code cyclists" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Bicycles should be fitted with front and rear lights to make cyclists more visible in the dark.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">According to the THINK! Cycling Campaign, the number of cyclists seriously injured has increased in recent years, faster than the increase in cyclists on the roads. If you are planning to start <a href="rules-for-cyclists.html">cycling</a> on the road, it is important to make sure you have a full understanding of the Highway Code and know how to keep yourself safe. Below we have outlined some of the key rules from the Highway Code for cyclists to follow.<br /><span></span></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Section 59</strong><br />Section 59 of the Highway Code explains the appropriate clothing cyclists should wear in order to make it easier for other road users to spot them and help to keep them protected in the case of a collision.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Cyclist clothing:</strong><br /><ul><li><strong>Helmet &ndash; </strong>Your 	cycle helmet should conform to the current regulations, be the 	correct size for your head and be securely fastened.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	<strong>Appropriate fitted clothing &ndash; </strong>Your 	clothing should be tight fitted to prevent it getting tangled in the 	chain or wheel of your bicycle.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	<strong>Light clothing </strong>&ndash; 	Light and fluorescent clothing will help you to stand out in 	daylight and poor light.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	<strong>Reflective accessories</strong> 	&ndash; Strips on the helmet, as well as armbands and ankle bands will 	help you be seen in the dark.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span> </li></ul>  <strong>Section 60</strong><br /><span></span>  This section of the Highway Code is all about cyclists&rsquo; lights and reflectors. At night cyclists must have their white front and red rear lights lit. Their bicycles must also be fitted with a red rear reflector and amber pedal reflectors. White front reflectors and spoke reflectors can also increase your visibility to other road users. Flashing lights are permitted but cyclists riding in areas without street lighting should use a steady front lamp instead.<br /><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/375149_orig.jpg" alt="Highway code for cyclists UK" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Cyclists should use dedicated cycle lanes and routes wherever possible.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Section 61</strong><br /><span></span>  Section 61 covers cycle routes and other facilities for cyclists. If cycle routes are available cyclists should make use of them, as they can make their journeys safer. Cyclists should also use advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings, unless it is unsafe to do so.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 62</strong><br /><span></span>  Section 62 covers the use of cycle tracks, which can be used to make a journey safer. Cycle tracks are usually located away from the road, but are sometimes found alongside footpaths and pavements. Sometimes cycle tracks will have a separate path for pedestrians, however this is not always the case.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  If you are using a segregated path, it is important to make sure you stay on the right side of the track to avoid colliding with pedestrians. Be on high alert in case pedestrians pass into your lane without realising.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  If you are sharing a path, take extra care and give plenty of room to children, the elderly and disabled people. You should always be riding at a speed that would allow you to slow down and stop if necessary.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 63</strong><br /><span></span>  Cycle lanes are marked by a white line (which may be broken) and are found alongside the carriageway. Although not compulsory, you should use the lanes whenever practical as they can make your journey safer. If you need to leave the cycle lane, always check that it is safe to do so and signal to other road users.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 64</strong><br /><span></span>  Something that confuses many cyclists is whether or not they are allowed to cycle on the pavement. According to Laws HA 1835 section 72 &amp; RSA 1984, section 129, cyclists must not cycle on the pavement.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 65</strong><br /><span></span>  Cyclists can use bus lanes when permitted to by road signs. Take extra care and watch out for people getting on or off buses. Only overtake a bus pulling into a bus lane if it is safe to do so. Do not pass between the kerb and a bus when it is at a stop.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 66</strong><br /><span></span>  This section explains what cyclists should and should not do when riding on the road.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>You should:</strong><br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li> 	Keep both hands on the handlebars except 	when signalling or changing gear.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Keep both feet on the pedals.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Be considerate of other road users, 	taking extra care around blind and partially sighted pedestrians. 	Use your bell when necessary to signal you are nearby.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Ride single file on narrow or busy roads 	and when riding round bends<br /><span></span><br /><span></span> </li></ul>  <strong>You should not:</strong><br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li> 	Ride more than two abreast.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Ride close behind another vehicle.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Carry anything that will affect your 	balance or get tangled up in your wheels or chain.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span> </li></ul>  <strong>Section 67</strong><br /><span></span>  Follow the steps below to promote safety on the roads:<br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li> 	Look all around to ensure it is safe to 	move away from the kerb, turn corners or manoeuvre your bicycle.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Always use a clear signal to indicate 	your intentions to other road users.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Keep an eye out for obstructions in the 	road to prevent you from having to swerve to avoid them.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Leave plenty of room when passing parked 	vehicles and watch out for pedestrians stepping into your path.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Be aware of traffic coming up behind 	you.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Take extra care near road humps, 	narrowings and other traffic calming features.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Take care when overtaking other road 	users.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span> </li></ul>  <strong>Section 68</strong><br /><span></span>  Cyclists should not carry a passenger on their bicycle, unless it has been build to carry one. They must not ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner. Cyclists must not ride under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including some medications).<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 69</strong><br /><span></span>  Traffic signs and traffic light signals apply to all road users. Cyclists must obey them.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 70</strong><br /><span></span>  Just as there are parking rules for vehicles, there are also ones for cyclists. You should always aim to use cycle stands of cycle parking facilities wherever possible and avoid leaving your bike where it would cause an obstruction or hazard to others.  <br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 71</strong><br /><span></span>  A red traffic light applies to all road users. Cyclists must not cross the stop line if the traffic lights are red. Use the separate stop line for cyclists when practical.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <em>We hope this article has helped you gain a better understanding of the Highway Code for cyclists and given you more confidence in riding safely on the road.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;Are you thinking of buying a motorbike? Before you can ride it on the road, you will need to follow the <a href="/">Highway Code</a> by completing a Compulsory Basic Training course, also known as a CBT. Once you have passed the CBT you will be permitted to ride unaccompanied on the public road on a motorcycle <strong>up to 125 cc</strong>, with a power output <strong>not exceeding 11 kW</strong>. You must also ride with L-plates for up to two years.</div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/7897644_orig.jpg" alt="highway code motorbike" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">You must pass the CBT course before being able to ride on the road.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>What does the CBT involve?</strong><br /><br />The CBT course is designed to equip motorcyclists with the basic skills they need to ride safely on the road. Attendees are given a basic introduction to road safety and must carry out an eye test. They then have to do practical training, which teaches them how to control a bike, how to use gears, how to stop and start and how to carry out relevant safety checks.<br /><br />During the CBT course, motorcyclists have two hours accompanied on the road with a certified instructor. The instructor ensures that motorcyclists have the knowledge and skills to drive safely on the road and have a full understanding of the basics.<br /><br />If you successfully complete the CTB course, you will be given a DL196 certificate that permits you to ride a motorcycle solo <strong>up to 125cc, </strong>providing you are at least seventeen years old. You must display L-plates on the front and rear and must not carry passengers or ride on the motorway.<br /><br /><strong>Getting your <a href="http://www.1driver.co.uk/" target="_blank">full motorbike licence</a></strong><br /><br />After passing your CBT, you will have two years <a href="https://www.test.1driver.co.uk/">to pass the theory</a> and practical test to gain their full motorbike licence. If you do not pass within this time period, you will be required to retake your CBT.<br /><br />In order to gain your full motorbike licence you will need to first pass a theory test. This involves answering multiple-choice questions and completing a hazard perception test.<br /><br />Once you have passed your theory test, you will be able to take your practical motorcycle test. It is recommended that you read up on the Highway Code and have formal training beforehand.<br /><br />There are two types of full motorcycle licence. The first is a light motorcycle licence (A1) that restricts riders to any bike up <strong>to 125 cc</strong> and a power output of <strong>11 kW.</strong> The standard motorcycle licence (A) restricts you to riding a bike <strong>up to 25 kW </strong>and a power / weight ratio <strong>not exceeding 0.16 kW</strong> <strong>/ kg</strong> for the <u>first two years</u>. However after this period you can ride any size of bike.<br /><br /><strong>Highway Code rules for motorcyclists</strong></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/3312667_orig.jpg" alt="Highway Code for CBT" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">It is important to wear bright, protective clothing so other road users can easily spot you</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Section 83</strong><br />All motorcyclists and pillion passengers must wear protective helmets. Helmets must comply with the regulations and should be fastened securely. This applies to riders of motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, tricycles and quad bikes.<br /><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 84</strong><br />Motorcyclists are advised to wear eye protectors that comply with the regulations. If they eye protectors are scratched or poorly fitted, it can limit their view and cause potential hazards. It is also recommended that you wear ear protection, as well as strong boots, gloves and suitable clothing that will help to protect you if you are involved in an accident.<br /><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 85</strong><br />Motorcyclists with a full bike licence are only permitted to carry one pillion passenger who will be required to sit astride the bike on a proper seat. They should sit forward, with both feet on the footrests. You <u>should not</u> carry a pillion passenger if your motorcycle is not designed to do so. Provisional licence holders are <u>not permitted</u> to carry a pillion passenger.<br /><span></span><br /><strong>Section 86</strong><br />This section is all about making sure you are visible to other road users when riding in the daylight. Motorcyclists should wear a light or brightly coloured helmet, as well as florescent clothing or strips (often found on motorcycle jackets). Even with the right clothing, it is important to take extra care as other vehicle drivers may not see you or be able to judge your distance or speed correctly.<br /><span></span><br /><strong>Section 87</strong><br />This section of the Highway Code explains what you should wear to make sure you are visible to other road users in the dark. It is recommended that you wear reflective clothing or strips to improve your visibility. These will reflect the light from the headlamps of other vehicles, helping them to spot you from a longer distance.<br /><span></span><br /><strong>Section 88</strong><br />Section 88 of the Highway Code for CBT and motorbikes is all about manoeuvring. It is important that you are aware of what is behind and to the sides of you before manoeuvring. In traffic queues, you should always look for pedestrians crossing between vehicles, as well as vehicles changing lanes and emerging from junctions.<br /><span></span><br />Make sure you position your bike so that the drivers in front can see you in their mirrors. Always take great care and when filtering in slow-moving traffic, keep your speed low.  <br /><br /><span></span>  <em>We hope we have answered any questions you may have about the Highway Code for CBT and Highway Code for motorbikes in this article.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">From 1 October 2015 is illegal:<br />- for retailers to sell electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or e-liquids to someone under 18<br />- for adults to buy (or try to buy) tobacco products or e-cigarettes for someone under 18<br />- to smoke in private vehicles that are carrying someone under 18<br /><br /><strong>Rules about smoking in private vehicles</strong><br />Private vehicles must be smokefree if they are enclosed, there is more than one person present and one of them is under 18.<br /><br />The rules don&rsquo;t apply to e-cigarettes.<br /><br /><strong>Penalties</strong><br />The fixed penalty notice fine is &pound;50 (for person who smokes and for driver). Somebody who commits both offences could get 2 fines.&nbsp;<br />Private vehicles must be carrying more than one person to be smokefree so somebody who is 17 and smoking alone in a private vehicle won&rsquo;t be committing an offence.<br /><br />Enforcement officers (usually the police) will use their discretion to decide whether to issue a warning or a fixed penalty notice, or whether to refer an offence to court.<br /><br /><strong>What classes as an enclosed vehicle</strong><br />The legislation covers any private vehicle that is enclosed wholly or partly by a roof. A convertible car, or coupe, with the roof completely down and stowed is not enclosed and so isn&rsquo;t covered by the legislation. But a vehicle with a sunroof open is still enclosed and so is covered by the legislation.<br /><br />Sitting in the open doorway of an enclosed vehicle is covered by the legislation.<br /><br />The rules apply to motorhomes, campervans and caravans when they are being used as a vehicle but don&rsquo;t apply when they are being used as living accommodation.<br /><br /><strong>The rules don&rsquo;t apply to:</strong><br /><br />- boats, ships and aircraft, as they have their own rules<br />- work vehicles and public transport, as they are already covered by smokefree legislation<br /><br /><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/new-rules-about-tobacco-e-cigarettes-and-smoking-1-october-2015/new-rules-about-tobacco-e-cigarettes-and-smoking-1-october-2015" target="_blank">gov.co.uk</a></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/4599552_orig.jpg" alt="do not smoke in car" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">It will be an offence for a person of any age to smoke in a private vehicle that is carrying someone who is under 18</div> </div></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">The best way to keep your children safe when they are out and about is to ensure they know how to cross a road safely and have a good understanding of the <strong>Highway Code</strong>. Below we have provided key safety rules that you should follow yourself and teach to your children.<br /><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/6019768_orig.jpg" alt="highway code kids" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">It is important to start teaching your children about road safety as early as possible. </div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Road safety for children</strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Read through the rules below with your children to ensure they understand road safety. It is good to practice with them, so that when they are older and perhaps walking to school on their own, they will know how to get their safely.<br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li>It 	is important to firstly plan your journey to make sure you know 	where you are going, leave your self plenty of time and inform your 	parent or guardian where you are going. <br /><span></span> 	</li><li>If 	there is a pavement or footpath for you to walk on, use it.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>If 	there is not a pavement, you should walk on the right side of the 	road, facing the traffic. Take extra care.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>If 	you are with other people, walk single file around bends, at night 	or if there is a lot of road traffic.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>Take 	care when crossing cycle lanes on the road. Bicycles are not as 	noisy as other traffic and may be harder to spot.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>If 	you are looking after someone younger than you, always hold their 	hand when crossing the road.</li></ul><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>How to cross a road safely</strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  It is important that your children know how to cross a road safely. This is something that you will need to practice with them, so that they build up confidence in making safe decisions. You can read through the rules below with your children to help them get a better understanding of how to cross roads safely.<br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(134, 134, 134); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">1. Find 	the safest place to cross</strong><br />If there is a zebra, pelican or traffic light crossing, always use it. You can also rely on police officers, school crossing patrols (lollypop men and ladies) as well as traffic wardens to help you cross roads safely. If you cannot find a crossing nearby, make sure you stop in a place where you can see clearly a long the road, from all directions and that road users can see you.<br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(134, 134, 134); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">2. Stop 	and look all around</strong><br />Stand on the pavement, a little way back from the kerb, but so you can see if there are any vehicles coming. Give yourself plenty of time to look around.<br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(134, 134, 134); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">3. Look 	and listen</strong><br />Use your eyes and ears to look all around for traffic and listen. Sometimes you will be able to hear traffic before you can see it.<br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(134, 134, 134); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">4. Wait 	until it is safe to cross</strong><br />If traffic is coming, let is pass. Make sure there is a safe gap and that you have plenty of time to get to the other side, before you begin to cross.<br /><br /><strong style="color: rgb(134, 134, 134); font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">5. Look 	and listen again</strong><br />When it is safe to do so, walk straight across the road to get to the other side. Keep looking and listening as you do so. Always walk, never run.<br /><span></span><br /><strong>Clothing for children</strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Here in the UK we get a lot of poor weather. To make your children more visible to road users, it is a good idea to ensure they are wearing bright clothing at night or in bad weather. Fluorescent materials will also be good for highlighting their presence in daylight and at dusk. Reflective materials will do the same, only at nighttime.&nbsp; <br /><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/7633939_orig.jpg" alt="highway code for kids UK" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Special car seats are required for children under the age of 12 and under 135cms in height.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Child passengers in vehicles</strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  When riding in a vehicle, the law says that seatbelts must be worn at all times. If your child is under the age of twelve and under 135cms in height, they should also use a child seat, designed for their size.<br /><br /><strong>Rules for children:</strong><br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li>Do 	not block the driver&rsquo;s view in the mirror.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>Make 	sure you do not distract the driver.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>Never 	lean or wave out of the window or throw anything out.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>Only 	open doors and windows when you have been told it is safe to do so.<br /><span></span> 	</li><li>Always 	use the door on the pavement side of the car when getting out.<br /></li></ul><span></span>  <em>We hope our Highway Code for kids has provided you with the information you need.

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Rule 96 of The Highway Code has been updated on 2 March 2015.<br /><br /><strong><a href="rules-for-drivers-and-motorcyclists-alcohol-and-drugs.html">New rule 96</a>:</strong><br /><br />You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive under the influence of drugs or medicine. For medicines, check with your doctor or pharmacist and do not drive if you are advised that you may be impaired.<br /><br />You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive if you have illegal drugs or certain medicines in your blood above specified limits. It is highly dangerous so never take illegal drugs if you intend to drive; the effects are unpredictable, but can be even more severe than alcohol and result in fatal or serious road crashes. Illegal drugs have been specified at very low levels so even small amounts of use could be above the specified limits. The limits for certain medicines have been specified at higher levels, above the levels generally found in the blood of patients who have taken normal therapeutic doses. If you are found to have a concentration of a drug above its specified limit in your blood because you have been prescribed or legitimately supplied a particularly high dose of medicine, then you can raise a statutory medical defence, provided your driving was not impaired by the medicine you are taking.<br /><br /><strong><span>Laws RTA 1988 sect 4 &amp; Law RTA 1988 sect 5A</span></strong></div>  <div><div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div> <hr class="styled-hr" style="width:100%;"></hr> <div style="height: 20px; overflow: hidden; width: 100%;"></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Old version of this rule:<br /><br />You&nbsp;<strong style="">MUST NOT</strong>&nbsp;drive under the influence of drugs or medicine. Check the instructions or ask your doctor or pharmacist. Using illegal drugs is highly dangerous. Never take them if you intend to drive; the effects are unpredictable, but can be even more severe than alcohol and may result in fatal or serious road crashes.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong style="">Law RTA 1988 sect 4</strong></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Halloween is a fun and exciting holiday, but as a result of increased foot traffic, the potential for vehicle related accidents with young pedestrians is significantly greater. Minimise the risk of accidents on the road by following our Halloween traffic safety tips below.</div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/2288421_orig.jpg" alt="Halloween safety tips" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Watch out for children who may think it’s a good idea to take a break on the roadside!</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Drive slowly through residential areas</strong><br />Children can be unpredictable at the best of times, let alone when they are excited on a night like Halloween. If you happen to be driving through residential neighbourhoods on Halloween, make sure you drive extra slowly and be especially alert.<br /><br /><strong>Take extra time to look out for children</strong><br />When you are driving around on Halloween, make sure you put extra time and effort into looking out for children who may be standing at crossings, junctions and on curbs. Kids can dart out onto the road at any time. They are likely to be caught up in the excitement of trick or treating and will be less aware of cars, so make sure you are watchful of their presence.<br /><br /><strong>Signal for children to cross the road</strong><br />Even if you have spent time showing your children how to cross the road properly, be mindful that not all parents will have done the same. Sometimes kids panic when it comes to crossing the roads and their actions can be erratic and dangerous. If you see children waiting to cross the road you are driving on, slow down, stop and providing there are not any cars coming the other way, signal for them to cross in front.<br /><br /><strong>Enter and exit driveways slowly</strong><br />Children are likely to be visiting houses in their local neighbourhood trick or treating, so make sure if you are pulling in or out of a driveway, you do it slowly and with great care.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Eliminate distractions inside your car</strong><br />As we mentioned before, you will need to be especially alert on Halloween as children can be unpredictable, particularly when they are excited. The best way to keep yourself alert is to minimise any distractions inside your car. Turn the radio off and disable your Bluetooth headset whilst you are driving around residential areas. This will allow you to fully concentrate on the road and your surroundings.<br /><br /><strong>Don&rsquo;t overtake cars that have stopped in the road</strong><br />Remember that parents are likely to be dropping off and picking up their children, so if there is a car stopped in the road, refrain from overtaking it. Children could dart out onto the road to get in the car or exit the car without looking, so you need to be on high alert.<br /><br />If you are dropping off your children, choose a safe spot to stop and make sure you alert other motorists by signalling and putting on your hazard lights.<br /><br /><strong>Take extra precautions on the road</strong><br />Anticipate that there is likely to be more pedestrian traffic on Halloween. You may want to consider driving slower than usual and turning on your headlights earlier in the day so you can spot children more easily. Children tend to go trick or treating between 5:00pm and 8:00pm so be especially careful when driving on the road during those hours.</div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/6781172_orig.jpg" alt="traffic safety tips for children" style="width:100%;max-width:333px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Watch out for children who may be walking along the road.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Keeping your trick or treaters safe</strong><br />If your children are planning on going out trick or treating on Halloween, make sure that you spend time going through tips on how to keep safe on the road. Do not let your children out unsupervised if they do not know how to cross a road safely. We also recommend putting reflective tape on your child&rsquo;s costume to make them more visible to drivers. Whilst equipping them with a flashlight will help them see where they are walking, make sure you tell them not to shine it at drivers, as this could distract them and cause them to temporarily lose control of their vehicles.<br /><br />Follow our <strong>Halloween safety tips</strong> and help to keep both drivers and pedestrians safe. We hope you have a happy holiday!<br /><br /> Image credits: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/usagj/8143063851/sizes/m/">U.S. Army Garrison Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seandreilinger/4063714296/sizes/m/">sean dreillinger</a><br /><span></span></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">It is fair to say that <a href="/using-the-road---roundabouts-184-to-190.html">roundabouts</a> are one of the hardest sections of the Highway Code for beginners to master. Make sure you read through this page a few times until you completely understand it. If you are learning to drive and have any questions, be sure to note them down and ask your driving instructor next time you have a lesson.<br /><br />&#8203;<span>&#8203;</span><span><a href="http://1driver.teachable.com/"><strong>DRIVING LESSONS ONLINE -&nbsp;that will save you &pound;'s on learning to drive!&nbsp;</strong><strong><font color="#ff0000">Start here &gt;&gt;</font></strong></a></span></div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;"><div class="wsite-youtube-wrapper wsite-youtube-size-auto wsite-youtube-align-center"> <div class="wsite-youtube-container">  <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Diu1k_5H45k?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Section 184</strong><br />Section 184 of the Highway Code is all about what to do when approaching a roundabout. To ensure you approach roundabouts safely you should look out for traffic signs, traffic lights and lane markings, all of which will help you to prepare for manoeuvring around the roundabout and identifying the correct lane.<br /><br /><u>When approaching a roundabout you should:</u><ul><li>Use the mirror-signal-manoeuvre process</li><li>Decide which exit you need to take as early as possible</li><li>Use the appropriate signal at the optimal time to inform other road users of your intentions</li><li>Get into the correct lane</li><li>Adjust your speed and position to the traffic conditions</li><li>Remain aware of the speed and position of the traffic around you</li></ul><br /><strong>Section 185</strong><br />Section 185 explains what you should do when you reach the roundabout. Again it is important to be aware of the traffic around you and look out for road users who may be signalling incorrectly or in some cases not signalling&nbsp;at all!<br /><br /><u>When reaching a roundabout you should:</u><ul><li>Always give priority to the traffic coming from the right, unless you have been directed otherwise by signs, road markings or traffic lights</li><li>Check if the road markings allow you to proceed without giving way (always look right before joining just in case)</li><li>Watch out for other road users on the roundabout</li><li>Check the traffic has moved off in front of you before you proceed to enter the roundabout</li></ul><br /> <strong>Section 186</strong><br />This section of the Highway Code explains the signals and positions required to exit a roundabout safely. Follow the rules and you will find maneuvering roundabouts to be much less stressful.<br /><br /><u>When taking the </u><u><strong>first exit </strong></u><u>(unless signs and markings indicate otherwise):</u><ul><li>Signal left and approach the exit in the left hand lane</li><li>Keep to the left on the roundabout and signal left to leave</li></ul><br /><u>When taking an </u><u><strong>exit to the right</strong></u><u> or </u><u><strong>going full circle</strong></u><u> (unless signs or markings indicate otherwise):</u><ul><li>Signal right and approach the exit in the right hand lane</li><li>Keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to reach your exit</li><li>Signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you intend to take</li></ul><br /><u>When taking any </u><u><strong>intermediate exit </strong></u><u>(unless signs or markings indicate otherwise):</u><ul><li>Select the appropriate lane on approach to the roundabout</li><li>Stay in the lane until you need to alter your lane to exit</li><li>Signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want to take</li></ul></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/5931440_orig.jpg" alt="highway code for roundabout" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">New drivers often find roundabouts tricky, but once you’ve grasped the basis of how they work, you will soon find it easy to approach and enter them safely.</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Section 187</strong><br /><span></span>  Section 187 explains the road users you should watch out for and give plenty of room to when approaching and entering a roundabout. This includes:<br /><span></span> <ul> 	<li> 	Pedestrians 	crossing the approach and exit roads<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Traffic 	crossing in front of you on the roundabout (look for vehicles 	intending to leave at the next exit)<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Traffic 	straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly (it happens more than you 	think!)<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Motorcyclists<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Cyclists 	and horse riders who may remain in the left hand lane and signal 	right if they intent to continue round the roundabout<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Long 	vehicles (including those towing trailers) which might have to take 	a different course or straddle lanes because of their length<br /><span></span> 	</li><li> 	Keep 	an eye out for all road users&rsquo; signals<br /></li></ul><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 188</strong><br /><span></span>  This section of the Highway Code is all about mini-roundabouts. You should apply the same rules to approaching and entering mini-roundabouts as you would normal roundabouts. It is important to remember that all vehicles must pass round the central markings, unless they are too large to do so. You will find that when driving around mini-roundabouts there is less room to manoeuvre and less time to signal, so take extra care.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 189</strong><br /><span></span>  If you are faced with a double mini-roundabout, make sure that you treat each roundabout separately (approaching and entering them in the same way you would any roundabout) and give way to traffic coming from your right.<br /><br /><span></span>  <strong>Section 190</strong><br /><span></span>  If you are approaching a set of mini-roundabouts (common at complex junctions) you need to treat each of them separately, following the rules stated above.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <em>We hope this information has provided you with the knowledge and confidence to approach and enter roundabouts safely. If you have any questions, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch.</em><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Image credits: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markybon/158582409/sizes/m/">MarkyBon</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rovernut/8384148138/sizes/m/">EthelRedThePetrolHead</a><br /><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-thin " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="uploads/3/2/9/2/3292309/2127190_orig.jpg" alt="highway code for roundabout" style="width:100%;max-width:500px" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Use road signs to help you determine what lane you need to be and what exit you need to take.</div> </div></div>
